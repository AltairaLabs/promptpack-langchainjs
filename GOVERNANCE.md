## Decision Making Process

### Regular Decisions

Most day-to-day decisions are made through:

1. **Discussion**: Issues, pull requests, or GitHub Discussions
2. **Consensus**: Agreement among active maintainers and contributors
3. **Action**: Implementation by maintainers or contributors

### Major Decisions

Major decisions that affect the project direction, architecture, or compatibility:

1. **Proposal**: Via GitHub issue or RFC (Request for Comments)
2. **Discussion**: Community discussion period (minimum 1 week)
3. **Feedback**: Incorporate community feedback
4. **Decision**: Final decision by maintainers with rationale documented
5. **Implementation**: Proceed with implementation

Major decisions include:

- Breaking changes to the API
- New major features or architectural changes
- Changes to project governance
- Addition or removal of dependencies
